This code:
-do the simulation taking energy (MeV) as a parameter;
-launches muon in a straight line WITHOUT random angle, such that B=5T;
-collects the initial and final muon energy (MeV) in the energyLoss.txt file if necessary;
-collects number of ionizations in the ionization_number.txt if necessary;
-collects the ionizations (with respective event number) in the particles.root file
